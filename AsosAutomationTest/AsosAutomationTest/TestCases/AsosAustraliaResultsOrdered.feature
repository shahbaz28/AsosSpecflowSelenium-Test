Feature: Use the website to change how search results are displayed

So that I can select my yellow t shirts

As an Australian customer

I want to be able to reorganize how they are displayed

Scenario: Display search results in 4 columns


Given I want to order a shirt

When I search for yellow t shirts in the Australian store

And I organize them in four columns

Then I should see some yellow t shirts organized in 4 columns
